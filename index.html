<p>SOCRadar CURIOSITY Wide Scan project is a subproject inside of our platform. We are constantly looking for open ports and banners of our customers&#x27; external ip addresses to generate alarms for any potential misconfiguration. </p>
<p>Our carefully designed system send TCP SYN packets in a very low rate (lower than 0.1 Mbps) and scans are distributed and randomized over the time to prevent any load on the destination ip addresses.</p>
